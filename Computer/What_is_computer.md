## What is Software | Type of Software | Definition of Software

 **What is Software** :  *[Computer](https://ecomputernotes.com/fundamental/introduction-to-computer/what-is-computer) software* , or only software, is a kind of program that enable a user to perform some specific task or used to operate a [computer](https://ecomputernotes.com/fundamental/introduction-to-computer/what-is-computer). It directs all the peripheral devices on the computer system – what to do and how to perform a task. PC Software plays the role of mediator between the user and computer hardware. Without software, a user can’t perform any task on a [digital computer](https://ecomputernotes.com/fundamental/introduction-to-computer/explain-about-the-evolution-of-digital-computers).

## **Type of Software**

![1707203531479](image/What_is_computer/1707203531479.png)

The software has mainly divided into two categories: Application software and System software.

**Application Software**

*Applications software* also called **end-user programs** or merely an application. It resides above system software. The end-user uses applications software for a specific purpose.

### System Software

*System Software* (the type of  **computer program** ) provides a platform to run a computer’s hardware and computer application to utilize system resources and solve their computation problem.

Example: IBM 1400 and 7000 Series, Control Data 3600 etc.

- **Third Generation (1964-1977)**

Features:

1. They used Integrated Circuit (IC) chips in place of the transistors.
2. Semi conductor memory devices were used.
3. The size was greatly reduced, the speed of processing was high, they were   more accurate and reliable.
4. Large Scale Integration (LSI) and Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) were also developed.
5. The mini computers were introduced in this generation.
6. They used high level language for programming.

Example: IBM 360, IBM 370 etc.

- **Fourth Generation :**

**Features:**

1. They used [Microprocessor](https://ecomputernotes.com/fundamental/terms/microprocessor) (VLSI) as their main switching element.
2. They are also called as micro computers or personal computers.
3. Their size varies from desktop to [laptop](https://ecomputernotes.com/fundamental/introduction-to-computer/laptop-computer) or palmtop.
