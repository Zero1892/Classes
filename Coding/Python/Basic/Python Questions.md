</body>
</html>
```

```python
# File: magical_realm/urls.py

from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path
from potion_shop.views import potion_list

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('', potion_list, name='potion_list'),
]
```

**Question 36: How would you create a new view and template to display a detailed view of each potion in your Django Potion Shop?**

Feel free to experiment with the Django code, create new realms, or ask more questions. Python is like a magical language, and Django is your spellbook for creating entire magical realms! If you have specific ideas or if there's a particular area you'd like to explore, let me know. Happy coding!

```python
# File: potion_shop/forms.py

from django import forms
from .models import Potion

class PotionForm(forms.ModelForm):
    class Meta:
        model = Potion
        fields = ['name', 'ingredients', 'price']
```

**Question 37: How would you modify this form to include an additional field for the potion's image?**

**Riddle 38: Django Spells - Create and Update Views!**

In Django, you can create views to handle creating new magical creatures (objects) and updating existing ones.

```python
# File: potion_shop/views.py

from django.shortcuts import render, get_object_or_404, redirect
from .models import Potion
from .forms import PotionForm

def create_potion(request):
    if request.method == 'POST':
        form = PotionForm(request.POST)
        if form.is_valid():
            form.save()
            return redirect('potion_list')
    else:
        form = PotionForm()
    return render(request, 'potion_shop/potion_form.html', {'form': form})

def update_potion(request, potion_id):
    potion = get_object_or_404(Potion, id=potion_id)
    if request.method == 'POST':
        form = PotionForm(request.POST, instance=potion)
        if form.is_valid():
            form.save()
            return redirect('potion_list')
    else:
        form = PotionForm(instance=potion)
    return render(request, 'potion_shop/potion_form.html', {'form': form})
```

**Question 38: How would you modify these views to handle a form with an image field?**

Now, let's dive into a captivating Django project.

**Riddle 39: The Ultimate Potion Shop!**

Extend your Django Potion Shop realm to allow users not only to view potions but also to create new potions and update existing ones.

```python
# File: magical_realm/urls.py

from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path
from potion_shop.views import potion_list, create_potion, update_potion

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('', potion_list, name='potion_list'),
    path('create/', create_potion, name='create_potion'),
    path('update/<int:potion_id>/', update_potion, name='update_potion'),
]
```

Create HTML templates for the new views:

```html
<!-- File: potion_shop/templates/potion_shop/potion_form.html -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Create/Update Potion</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Create/Update Potion</h1>
    <form method="post">
        {% csrf_token %}
        {{ form.as_p }}
        <button type="submit">Brew Potion</button>
    </form>
</body>
</html>
```

**Question 39: How would you modify the `potion_form.html` template to include an image input field?**

```bash
cd magical_realm
python manage.py startapp accounts
```

**Question 40: How would you modify the `accounts` app to include user registration functionality using Django's built-in forms?**

**Riddle 41: Django Spells - Decorators and Restricted Access!**

In Django, you can use decorators to cast spells that restrict access to certain magical places (views) only to authenticated users.

```python
# File: potion_shop/views.py

from django.contrib.auth.decorators import login_required

@login_required
def create_potion(request):
    # Your existing code for creating potions
```

**Question 41: How would you modify the `update_potion` view to require authentication using the `login_required` decorator?**

Now, let's embark on a more intricate Django project.

**Riddle 42: The Master Potion-Maker's Guild!**

Imagine you want to create a Django realm for a Potion-Maker's Guild. This realm should allow potion masters to create and manage their own potions.

```python
# File: potion_shop/models.py

from django.db import models
from django.contrib.auth.models import User

class Potion(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    ingredients = models.TextField()
    price = models.DecimalField(max_digits=5, decimal_places=2)
    creator = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
```

**Question 42: How would you modify the `Potion` model to associate each potion with its creator, who is a user in the Potion-Maker's Guild?**

Create a new view in the `potion_shop` app:

```python
# File: potion_shop/views.py

from django.contrib.auth.decorators import login_required
from .models import Potion

@login_required
def my_potions(request):
    potions = Potion.objects.filter(creator=request.user)
    return render(request, 'potion_shop/my_potions.html', {'potions': potions})
```

Create an HTML template for the new view:

```html
<!-- File: potion_shop/templates/potion_shop/my_potions.html -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My Potions</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>My Potions</h1>
    {% for potion in potions %}
        <div>
            <h2>{{ potion.name }}</h2>
            <p>Ingredients: {{ potion.ingredients }}</p>
            <p>Price: {{ potion.price }} gold coins</p>
        </div>
    {% endfor %}
</body>
</html>
```

# File: accounts/models.py

from django.contrib.auth.models import AbstractUser
from django.db import models

class CustomUser(AbstractUser):
    favorite_potion = models.CharField(max_length=100)
```

Don't forget to update your `settings.py` file to use the custom user model:

```python
# File: magical_realm/settings.py

# ...

AUTH_USER_MODEL = 'accounts.CustomUser'

# ...
```

**Question 44: How would you modify the `CustomUser` model to include a magical power level attribute for each user?**

In Django, you can use forms to allow users to input their magical preferences and use them in your views.

```python
# File: potion_shop/forms.py

from django import forms

class PreferenceForm(forms.Form):
    favorite_potion = forms.CharField(max_length=100)
```

**Question 50: How would you modify the `create_potion` view to also use the `PreferenceForm` for updating a user's favorite potion in the `CustomUser` model?**

Now, let's create a new Django view to handle preferences:

```python
# File: potion_shop/views.py

from django.shortcuts import render, redirect
from .forms import PreferenceForm
from django.contrib.auth.decorators import login_required
from django.contrib import messages

@login_required
def manage_preferences(request):
    if request.method == 'POST':
        form = PreferenceForm(request.POST)
        if form.is_valid():
            request.user.customuser.favorite_potion = form.cleaned_data['favorite_potion']
            request.user.customuser.save()
            messages.success(request, 'Preferences updated successfully!')
            return redirect('manage_preferences')
    else:
        form = PreferenceForm(initial={'favorite_potion': request.user.customuser.favorite_potion})
    return render(request, 'potion_shop/manage_preferences.html', {'form': form})
```

**Question 51: How would you create a link in the `base.html` template to navigate to the `manage_preferences` view?**

        {{ form.as_p }}
        <button type="submit">Update Preferences</button>
    </form>
</body>
</html>
```

**Riddle 52: Django Spells - Paginating Magical Creatures!**

In Django, when you have many magical creatures (objects) to display, you can use pagination spells to break them into pages.

```python
# File: potion_shop/views.py

from django.core.paginator import Paginator
from django.shortcuts import render
from .models import Potion

def all_potions(request):
    all_potions = Potion.objects.all()
    paginator = Paginator(all_potions, 10)  # Show 10 potions per page
    page = request.GET.get('page')
    potions = paginator.get_page(page)
    return render(request, 'potion_shop/all_potions.html', {'potions': potions})
```

**Question 52: How would you modify the `all_potions.html` template to display paginated potions with page navigation links?**

Create a new HTML template for displaying all potions:

```html
<!-- File: potion_shop/templates/potion_shop/all_potions.html -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>All Potions</title>
</head>

    <h1>All Potions</h1>
    {% for potion in potions %}
        <div>
            <h2>{{ potion.name }}</h2>
            <p>Ingredients: {{ potion.ingredients }}</p>
            <p>Price: {{ potion.price }} gold coins</p>
        </div>
    {% endfor %}

    <div class="pagination">
        <span class="step-links">
            {% if potions.has_previous %}
                <a href="?page=1">« first</a>
                <a href="?page={{ potions.previous_page_number }}">previous</a>
            {% endif %}

            <span class="current">
                Page {{ potions.number }} of {{ potions.paginator.num_pages }}.
            </span>

            {% if potions.has_next %}
                <a href="?page={{ potions.next_page_number }}">next</a>
                <a href="?page={{ potions.paginator.num_pages }}">last »</a>
            {% endif %}
        </span>

**Riddle 53: Django Spells - Magical Middleware!**

In Django, middleware allows you to perform magic before or after each request reaches your views.

```python
# File: magical_realm/middleware.py

class MagicalMiddleware:
    def __init__(self, get_response):
        self.get_response = get_response

    def __call__(self, request):
        # Magic before the view is called
        response = self.get_response(request)
        # Magic after the view is called
        return response
```

**Question 53: How would you register the `MagicalMiddleware` in the Django project's settings to make it active?**

Now, let's create a new Django project inspired by our magical journey.

**Riddle 54: The Potion Trading Platform!**

Imagine you want to create a Django realm where potion masters can trade potions with each other. You can use Django's magical forms and views to facilitate these trades.

```python
# File: potion_shop/models.py

from django.db import models
from django.contrib.auth.models import User

class PotionTrade(models.Model):
    sender = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='sent_trades')
    receiver = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='received_trades')
    potion_offered = models.ForeignKey('Potion', on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='offered_trades')
    potion_requested = models.ForeignKey('Potion', on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='requested_trades')
    message = models.TextField()
    is_accepted = models.BooleanField(default=False)
```

**Question 54: How would you create a Django view and form for potion trades, allowing users to offer and request potions from each other?**

Create a new HTML template for displaying trade requests:

```html
<!-- File: potion_shop/templates/potion_shop/trade_requests.html -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Trade Requests</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Trade Requests</h1>
    {% for trade in trade_requests %}
        <div>
            <p>From: {{ trade.sender.username }}</p>
            <p>Offered Potion: {{ trade.potion_offered.name }}</p>
            <p>Requested Potion: {{ trade.potion_requested.name }}</p>
            <p>Message: {{ trade.message }}</p>
            <form method="post" action="{% url 'accept_trade' trade.id %}">
                {% csrf_token %}
                <button type="submit">Accept Trade</button>
            </form>
        </div>
    {% endfor %}
</body>
</html>
```

**Riddle 55: Django Spells - Redirecting and Messaging!**

In Django, after performing a magical action, you can redirect users to a new magical place and provide them with messages.

```python
# File: potion_shop/views.py

from django.shortcuts import render, redirect
from django.contrib import messages
from django.contrib.auth.decorators import login_required
from .models import PotionTrade

@login_required
def accept_trade(request, trade_id):
    trade = PotionTrade.objects.get(id=trade_id)
    if trade.receiver == request.user:
        trade.is_accepted = True
        trade.save()
        messages.success(request, 'Trade accepted successfully!')
    else:
        messages.error(request, 'You are not the intended receiver of this trade.')

    return redirect('trade_requests')
```

**Question 55: How would you modify the `trade_requests.html` template to display a link for each trade that, when clicked, will lead to the `accept_trade` view?**

Feel free to experiment with the Django code, create new realms, or ask more questions. Django is like a magical framework, and you're the master of its incantations! If you have specific ideas or if there's a particular area you'd like to explore, let me know. Happy coding!

Certainly! Let's continue our magical Django journey with more enchanting concepts and a captivating project.

**Riddle 56: Django Spells - Magical Tests!**

In Django, you can cast magical tests to ensure that your spells (code) work as intended. Tests help you catch bugs before they wreak havoc in your magical realm.

```python
# File: potion_shop/tests.py

from django.test import TestCase
from .models import Potion

class PotionTests(TestCase):
    def test_create_potion(self):
        potion = Potion.objects.create(name='Invisibility Potion', ingredients='Moonstone, Fairy Wing', price=25)
        self.assertEqual(potion.name, 'Invisibility Potion')
        self.assertEqual(potion.ingredients, 'Moonstone, Fairy Wing')
        self.assertEqual(potion.price, 25)
```

**Question 56: How would you run this test to ensure that creating a potion works as expected in your Django realm?**

Now, let's create a new Django project inspired by our magical journey.

**Riddle 57: The Potion Inventory API!**

Imagine you want to create a Django realm where potion masters can interact with a magical API to manage their potion inventory. You can use Django Rest Framework to build this API.

```bash
# Install Django Rest Framework first using: pip install djangorestframework
```

Create a new Django app for the API:

```bash
cd magical_realm
python manage.py startapp api
```

**Question 57: How would you create a Django model and serializer for potions in the `api` app?**

Create a Django model for potions:

```python
# File: api/models.py

from django.db import models

class Potion(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    ingredients = models.TextField()
    price = models.DecimalField(max_digits=5, decimal_places=2)
```

Create a serializer for the potion model:

```python
# File: api/serializers.py

from rest_framework import serializers
from .models import Potion

class PotionSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = Potion
        fields = ['id', 'name', 'ingredients', 'price']
```

Create a view for listing potions using the API:

```python
# File: api/views.py

from rest_framework import generics
from .models import Potion
from .serializers import PotionSerializer

class PotionList(generics.ListCreateAPIView):
    queryset = Potion.objects.all()
    serializer_class = PotionSerializer
```

Create URLs for the API:

```python
# File: api/urls.py

from django.urls import path
from .views import PotionList

urlpatterns = [
    path('potions/', PotionList.as_view(), name='potion-list'),
]
```

Include the API URLs in your main `urls.py`:

```python
# File: magical_realm/urls.py

from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include
from api.views import PotionList

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('api/', include('api.urls')),
]
```

**Riddle 58: Django Spells - Magical Authentication in the API!**

In Django Rest Framework, you can cast magical spells to handle authentication for your API.

```python
# File: api/views.py

from rest_framework import generics, permissions
from .models import Potion
from .serializers import PotionSerializer

class PotionList(generics.ListCreateAPIView):
    queryset = Potion.objects.all()
    serializer_class = PotionSerializer
    permission_classes = [permissions.IsAuthenticated]  # Require authentication for API access
```

**Question 58: How would you create a Django view in the API to retrieve a single potion by its ID, ensuring that only authenticated users can access it?**

Feel free to experiment with the Django code, create new realms, or ask more questions. Django is like a magical framework, and you're the conjurer of digital realms! If you have specific ideas or if there's a particular area you'd like to explore, let me know. Happy coding!

Certainly! Let's continue our magical Django journey with more enchanting concepts and a captivating project.

**Riddle 59: Django Spells - Magical Permissions in the API!**

In Django Rest Framework, you can cast magical permissions to control who can perform certain actions in your API.

```python
# File: api/views.py

from rest_framework import generics, permissions
from .models import Potion
from .serializers import PotionSerializer
from .permissions import IsPotionCreator

class PotionDetail(generics.RetrieveUpdateDestroyAPIView):
    queryset = Potion.objects.all()
    serializer_class = PotionSerializer
    permission_classes = [permissions.IsAuthenticated, IsPotionCreator]
```

**Question 59: How would you create a Django permission named `IsPotionCreator` to ensure that only the creator of a potion can update or delete it in the API?**

Create a new file for the permissions:

```bash
touch api/permissions.py
```

Add the `IsPotionCreator` permission to `api/permissions.py`:

```python
# File: api/permissions.py

from rest_framework import permissions

class IsPotionCreator(permissions.BasePermission):
    def has_object_permission(self, request, view, obj):
        # Check if the user requesting the action is the creator of the potion
        return obj.creator == request.user
```

Include the new API view in your `api/urls.py`:

```python
# File: api/urls.py

from django.urls import path
from .views import PotionList, PotionDetail

urlpatterns = [
    path('potions/', PotionList.as_view(), name='potion-list'),
    path('potions/<int:pk>/', PotionDetail.as_view(), name='potion-detail'),
]
```

Now, the API has views to list all potions and retrieve, update, or delete a single potion by its ID, with proper authentication and permissions.

**Riddle 60: Django Spells - Magical Documentation with Swagger!**

In Django Rest Framework, you can use magical tools like Swagger to automatically generate documentation for your API.

```bash
# Install Django Rest Swagger first using: pip install django-rest-swagger
```

Include the Swagger documentation in your project's `urls.py`:

```python
# File: magical_realm/urls.py

from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include
from api.views import PotionList
from rest_framework_swagger.views import get_swagger_view

schema_view = get_swagger_view(title='Magical Potion Inventory API')

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('api/', include('api.urls')),
    path('api/docs/', schema_view),
]
```

Now, you can visit `/api/docs/` in your browser to explore the magical documentation for your Potion Inventory API.
