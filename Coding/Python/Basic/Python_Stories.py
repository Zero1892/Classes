Poem: Python's Code Dance

In a world of bits and bytes, where languages prance,
Python emerges, a language of elegant stance.
Indentations and colons, its syntax so clear,
A dance of code, with each line drawing near.

Loops and functions, they gracefully waltz,
In the rhythm of logic, where elegance exalts.
Variables twirl, like dancers on the stage,
Strings whisper stories, with each printed page.

If conditions tango, with choices so bold,
Operators cha-cha, as their stories unfold.
In this code ballet, bugs take flight,
Caught by the debugger, in the soft moonlight.

So, let your code dance, in the Pythonic way,
A ballet of logic, where errors sway.
For in this language, where beauty is found,
Python's code dance, a symphony unbound.

Poem: Python's Time Dance

In the realm of Python, where moments intertwine,
The datetime module, a keeper of time.
Dates and hours in a waltz so fine,
A dance of seconds, a rhythm sublime.

Formatting strings with a poetic rhyme,
strftime and strptime in a fluent chime.
Time zones and deltas, a journey through space,
Python's time dance, an elegant embrace.

Parsing strings to moments, a task so grand,
datetime objects, like grains of sand.
Arithmetic with time, a mathematical trance,
In Python's world, where time finds its dance.

Poem: Python's Sorting Symphony

In Python's realm, where sequences play,
A sorting symphony, both night and day.
With lists and tuples in rhythmic sway,
The sort method orchestrates, leading the way.

Ascending, descending, the melody clear,
Elements rearranged, in harmonious cheer.
Strings, numbers, in a sorted veneer,
Python's sorting symphony, always near.
